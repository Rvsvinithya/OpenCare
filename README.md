Additionally, OpenHealth features a dedicated medical assistant powered by Llama-3, our AI chatbot. Llama-3 is finely tuned to provide personalized assistance to medical professionals, capable of accepting voice inputs and delivering expert advice akin to a doctor's guidance. This feature enhances communication and collaboration between healthcare providers, ensuring efficient patient care.

We also provide a notification section for doctors to ask help from other doctors based on their specialization.
Developed and trained machine learning models for detecting brain tumors, lung disease, breast cancer, and diabetes using medical imaging and clinical data to support accurate diagnosis.
Integrated a Llama-3 Medical Chatbot based AI medical assistant to provide real-time conversational support and clinical decision guidance for doctors. Implemented NLP-driven response generation to deliver instant second opinions and streamline doctor to doctor collaboration.
Designed and implemented a real-time notification system to alert doctors for urgent cases and specialist consultations
